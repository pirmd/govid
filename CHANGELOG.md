  minor features and probably more new bugs to hunt.

- add support for basic authentication.

## [0.1.0] - 2022-09-10

- minimal set of features allowing basic interaction with plain-text files from
  the web-app. This version is more a proof of concept than anything else, it
  notably does not implement basic security approach for web-facing apps.
